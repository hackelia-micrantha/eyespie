### People

Could do dating as well with scanning someones face?

If you like them, try to find them, with an excuse to talk to them and a compliment to photograph.

Maybe there is an extra cost for doing people.

Alternatively, can use face detection to prevent scanning of people.

Perhaps a hybrid mode where a [veil](https://veil.micrantha.com) api is used to abstract people photos

And you have to guess the person!
