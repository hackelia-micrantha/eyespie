## Clues

Clues are all about points for the user.

The degree of difficulty of finding a clue should increase the points.

### Proofs

Before a clue is selected, there are clue candidates used as proof

A proof is used to verify the guess, but also to select the best clue for description with the maximum point value.

### Storage

Clues are saved as a serialized json object.

Clues are naturally sortable so the first clue is the candidate.
