## Scanning

Scanning things is the main functionality of the app used to generate clues and proofs.

The process is as follows:

1. camera video stream started

2. clue analyzers process images in realtime

   - an overhead display of clues allows insights

3. user can edit clues or save

   - goal is to not have to edit

4. editing can choose specific detected things

   - selecting image sub areas causes analyzers to re-run

5. cropped image saved, database record created

## Usage

The scanned objects are available to a location and referenced by player
