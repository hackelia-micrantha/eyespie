> A game of "eye spy" with machine vision for clues and proof.

See the [project phases and sprints](https://github.com/orgs/hackelia-micrantha/projects/3/views/2).

## Use Case

Alice has a photo of something, the app generates clues and a fake image (color, labels)

Bob is walking nearby (or is playing with alice) and is notified.

Bob takes a picture of the thing, the app generates proof and makes a guess (embeddings).

Bob guesses the photo and gets points, or has to guess again.

Alice gets participation points.

## Notes

The project is also SDK development for future applications (Project 'Bluebell') which has to be split out still.

Offline support for remote areas is a critical requirement.

Generative AI has signifantly changed the scope of the project since its inception.

The goal is that features will be modular and in-app purchases.

Apologies for the lack of testing and continuous integration - resource constrained and am a perfect programmer - but has been designed to support.
