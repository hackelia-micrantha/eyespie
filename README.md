> A game of "eye spy" with machine vision for clues and proof.

See the [project phases and sprints](https://github.com/orgs/hackelia-micrantha/projects/3/views/2).

## Use Case

Alice has a photo of something, the app generates clues and a fake image (color, labels)

Bob is walking nearby (or is playing with alice) and is notified.

Bob takes a picture of the thing, the app generates proof and makes a guess (embeddings).

Bob guesses the photo and gets points, or has to guess again.

Alice gets participation points.

## Notes

Apologies for the lack of testing and continuous integration - resource constrained and am a perfect programmer.
